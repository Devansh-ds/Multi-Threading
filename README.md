# Java Multithreading Basics

This repository contains code snippets and examples created while learning Java Multithreading concepts. The learning process was guided by a YouTube tutorial, with hands-on exercises to deepen the understanding of multithreading and concurrency.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each focusing on a specific multithreading topic:

- **Basics**: Introduction to Java threads, `Runnable`, and `Thread` classes.
- **Synchronization**: Examples showcasing the use of synchronized blocks and methods to avoid race conditions.
- **ExecutorService**: Code demonstrating the `ExecutorService` framework for managing thread pools.
- **BookSemaphores**: Solutions and examples related to semaphores, with practical problems from a semaphore book.
- **ConcurrentCollection**: Examples of thread-safe collections and barriers, such as `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, and `CyclicBarrier`.
- **ForkJoin**: Implementation of parallelism using the `ForkJoinPool` framework.
- **Locks**: Usage of explicit locks (`ReentrantLock`, `ReadWriteLock`) for fine-grained control over thread synchronization.
- **Misc**: Miscellaneous concepts and examples in multithreading.

## Features Covered

- Thread creation and lifecycle
- Synchronization and locks
- Semaphore examples and applications
- Concurrent collections and utilities
- Fork/Join framework for parallelism
